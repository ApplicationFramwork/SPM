### Project Description
With the current pandemic, the School Management Systems plays a significant role in improving the engagement between students and teachers. Today Student Management Systems were have been able to streamline the complexity of the work related to traditional School Management. The web-based E-school management system which we developed is a better solution for all these problems. The system has two main user roles as the Staff and the Students. The staff can be classified into two types as Admin and Teachers. The system can perform User Login, Student Details Management, Teacher Details Management, Marks Management, Attendance Management, Lectures Management, Notices Management and Report Generations in PDF and Excel Formats.
